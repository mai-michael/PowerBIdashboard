# PowerBIdashboard

In this project, I built a Power BI dashboard  summarizing the Northwind Database via an ODATA feed. It is a sample database that is shipped along with Microsoft Access. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers. Data was prepared by SPICED Academy Instructor Paul Wlodkowski and available in his repository.
