# PowerBIdashboard

In this project, I built a Power BI dashboard  summarizing the Northwind Database via an ODATA feed. It is a sample database that is commonly used for test building databases. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers.
