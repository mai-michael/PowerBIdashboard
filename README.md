# PowerBIdashboard


SQL and Metabase
In this project, I built a dashboard using open source service Metabase summarizing the Northwind Database. It is a sample database that is shipped along with Microsoft Access. The data is about “Northwind Traders”, a fictional company. The database contains all sales transactions between the company and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers. Data was prepared by SPICED Academy Instructor Paul Wlodkowski and available in his repository.

For this project data was apploaded into PostgreSQL Database in Amazon RDS instance. Then Metabase was installed on an AWS EC2 Machine and used for creating a publically available Metabase dashboard (is not available anymore: EC2 stopped and RDS deleted).
